For an overview of this project from the perspective of a user, see the document "[Using ArcGIS WebMaps in SAS Visual Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sassoftware/sas-visualanalytics-geowebmap/master/doc/UsingArcGISWebMapsInSASVA.pdf)."

A pre-built deployment of the current version is available for use at https://cdn.developer.sas.com/geowebmap/1.5.2. Available versions include [1.5.2](https://cdn.developer.sas.com/geowebmap/1.5.2/) and [1.4.0](https://cdn.developer.sas.com/geowebmap/1.4.0/).

## Project

This project presents a web page with an ArcGIS map designed to serve as a data-driven content for reports built with SAS Visual Analytics. It is a fork from [jsapi-resources](https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources), Esri's template for JS applications, using ArcGIS for JavaScript 4.x.

### Usage

The built application is a collection of HTML and Javascript files that can be served from any web server. You may download a zip of these files (sas-visualanalytics-geowebmap.zip) from the [Releases](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-visualanalytics-geowebmap/releases) page.

Alternately, you can build and modify the code yourself with the following steps:

- Download the project.
- Open a command-line context at the project directory.
- `yarn install`
- `yarn build`
- Copy the built application from the `build` directory to your web server's directory.

#### Prerequisites

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager.

#### Other options

Run `yarn start` to compile and then kick off a webpack-dev-server to host the results locally for immediate testing.

Note that [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) builds assume
deployment at the web server's root directory. To deploy elsewhere, see
React's "[Building for Relative Paths](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#building-for-relative-paths)". Also, refer to this project's [setAbsolutePaths.sh](setAbsolutePaths.sh) script for setting the homepage.

#### GitHub Pages hosting

For incidental testing, you may use the version hosted by GitHub Pages at
https://sassoftware.github.io/sas-visualanalytics-geowebmap/. However,
due to quota constraints, that deployment has no guaranteed availability
nor any expectation of support. Do not rely upon it for production use. Furthermore, now that a build is hosted on the [SAS developer CDN](https://cdn.developer.sas.com/geowebmap/1.5.2/), this deployment on GitHub Pages is deprecated.

#### Assets (styles, fonts, and images)

By default, ArcGIS JavaScript assets (approximately 40 MB) are distributed with the build. To distribute them most efficiently, the hosting web server should configure several mime types. An example [.htaccess](public/.htaccess) file is included. See developers.arcgis.com for further information.

To load them from arcgis.com instead, two changes are required. The relevant code has been flagged with the comment "ASSET SOURCE".

## Application

### Overview

From SAS Visual Analytics, users can add a "Data-Driven Content" object to their report and set its "Web Content" url to the deployment directory. They can then use the supported query string arguments to customize the type and styling of the visualization layer in which the report data appears above the ArcGIS map.

Data-driven content aggregates report data. Keep this in mind when including location coordinate information, which is required for scatter and bubble plots. The default aggregation method for numeric columns is "sum", and summing coordinates (e.g, latitude and longitude) will produce values that cannot be geographically located. For these coordinate columns, either switch their aggregation type to something less disruptive (such as "average"), or take other steps to ensure that there is only one category value per location, so that no aggregation of their coordinates will occur. For instance, VA's "Geographic Items," when set to the data type "custom coordinates," protect against inappropriate aggregation, and their use is preferred.

### Query string arguments

| Argument                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| visualizationType                | Optional. Possible values include "scatter", "bubble", "choropleth," "filtered", or "none". If unspecified, the value will be inferred from other arguments or left as "scatter". Scatter plots, bubble plots, and choropleths appear as a SAS layer, capable of participating in filtering, interactions, and selection. "Filtered" layers simply include a named external feature layer filtered by geoId.                                                |

| size                             | The label of the column containing the size measurement. Required for bubble visualizations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| color                            | The label of the column containing the color measurement. Optional for bubble and choropleth visualizations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| animation                        | The label of the column containing the date used when animating through the data. Optional. Animations are not currently supported in choropleths or 3D views, and they should be considered experimental. It has been observed that performance degrades rapidly when the data's row count enters the tens of thousands. Acceptable date formats are those correctly interpreted by [Moment](http://momentjs.com/), which include RFC2822 and ISO formats. |

## Data-driven visualizations

Information about using data-driven visualizations in SAS Visual Analytics is found both at the repository supporting general [third-party visualizations](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-visualanalytics-thirdpartyvisualizations/blob/master/README.md) and at the post [Programming Considerations for Data-Driven Visualizations](http://go.documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=vacdc&cdcVersion=8.2&docsetId=varef&docsetTarget=n109mqtyl6quiun1mwfgtcn2s68b.htm).

At a high level, data-driven visualizations are HTML pages listening to the window's "message" event for data having a format similar to the following:

```
{
    data: {
        columns: [
            {name: "carColumnName", label: "car", type: "string"},
            {name: "priceColumnName", label: "price", type: "number"}
        ],
        data: [
            ["Ford", 1000],
            ["Toyota", 2000],
            ["BMW", 1500]
        ],
        resultName: "sasVAResultName",
        rowCount: 3
    }
}
```

See [SampleData.json](src/sas/ArcGISWebMapProvider/SampleData.json) for a more complete example.
